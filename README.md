# Parallel-Inplace-Radix-Sort

A demonstrative Parallel inplace radix sort implementation, that technically is not "inplace" as it has constant memory per created thread (thread itself and two bounds indices).

Including benchmarking and a script to plot the results.
Used as part of a personal research project for university.
